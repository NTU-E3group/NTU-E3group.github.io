            "Housed in the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU), our group, directed by Professor I-Yun Lisa Hsieh (謝依芸), is dedicated to overcoming the challenges of sustainable energy transition. Our focus is on reducing CO<sub>2</sub> and pollutant emissions while addressing the rising demand for energy. Through innovative research and practical data-driven solutions, we aim to accelerate the global and local shift to net-zero emissions.",
            "Starting with electric mobility, our research has grown to encompass a wide range of energy systems, including renewable energy, smart grid management, green logistics, and hydrogen energy economics. We also address broader societal issues such as carbon pricing and green finance, all to support a just and sustainable transition to new energy solutions.",
